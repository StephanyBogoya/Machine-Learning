## Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow - Specialization Course

[ Week 1- Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/StephanyBogoya/Machine-Learning/blob/main/C2_W1_Lab_1_cats_vs_dogs.ipynb)
- [x] Explore the example data of Dogs vs. Cats
- [x] Build and train a neural network to classify between the two pets
- [x] Evaluate the training and validation accuracy

[ Week 2- Image Augmentation](https://github.com/StephanyBogoya/Machine-Learning/blob/main/C2_W2_Lab_1_cats_v_dogs_augmentation.ipynb)

- [x]  You can apply different preprocessing techniques such as rotate, flip, shear, or zoom on your existing images so you can simulate other data that the model should also learn from. This way, the model would see more variety in the images during training so it will infer better on new, previously unseen data.

[ Week 3- Transfer Learning](https://github.com/StephanyBogoya/Machine-Learning/blob/main/C2_W3_Lab_1_transfer_learning.ipynb)

- [x] You will see how you can use a pre-trained model to achieve good results even with a small training dataset. This is called transfer learning and you do this by leveraging the trained layers of an existing model and adding your own layers to fit your application.

[ Week 4- Multiclass Classifications](https://github.com/StephanyBogoya/Machine-Learning/blob/main/C2_W4_Lab_1_multi_class_classifier.ipynb)

- [x] Build a multiclass classifier for the Sign Language MNIST dataset.
- [x] Learn how to properly set up the ImageDataGenerator parameters and the model definition functions for multiclass classification.
- [x] Understand the difference between using actual image files vs images encoded in other formats and how this changes the methods available when using ImageDataGenerator
- [x] Code a helper function to parse a raw CSV file which contains the information of the pixel values for the images used.
